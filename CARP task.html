        <p class="caption">
            True/False poster version 3

    <a>
        <img src="image/True:False ver 3.jpg" width=350 height=500>
        <span>Minion pro regular font is used for the version 3 poster. Black and red triangles are used to create a contrast and to match with the logo. I also included lines to create a border for the poster.

        </span>

<div class="CARP-section-two">
    <div>
        <p class="caption">
            True/False poster version 1
        </p>
    </div>
    <a>
        <img src="image/True:False ver 1.jpg" width=350 height=500>
        <span>for the version 1, I have used Futura PT book oblique for the font. Also, I have used apple chancery for the date and the place for the festival. 1 point stroke is used with the font to make the text clearer and more obvious. Circles and rectangles are used to show repetition.

        </span>
    </a>

<div class="CARP-section-three">
    <div>
        <p class="caption">
            True/False poster version 2
        </p>
    </div>
    <a>
        <img src="image/True:False ver 2.jpg" width=350 height=500>
        <span>While for the version 2, I used American typewrite for the font and Futura PT book oblique for the url and the location. Gray background is used to create a kind of look like the shadow of a light from the camera at the right side. Also, the original camera graphic is black in color with a checked background. To match the color of the logo, I had removed the background and change the color of the graphic with Photoshop.
