                    <br>Throughout the whole project, I have used Adobe software which are almost completely new to me. 
                    I am not familiar with how to use them at first. 
                    However, with the help of the tutorials and practice, I got used to the interface of Illustrator. 
                    It was interesting when I was forming shapes and moving the around to create my own design. 
                    When a poster is finished, I felt proud of myself as the poster is what I want. 
                    On the other hand, I also noticed something. 
                    Even I did not plan to place the shape at that place, it turned out to look nice. 
                    Then, I realized that sometimes mistakes will make good design. 
                    With this thought in mind, I finished the posters for the typographic system task in a short period of time. 
                    Also, I realized that there is no rights and wrongs for design. 
                    Everyone has different view towards a design. 
                    A design does not always have to be fancy. 
                    In some cases, simple design is better. </br>

                   <br> While for InDesign, I am still figuring it out. 
                    The True/False festival posters took me a lot of time thinking the design of them. 
                    I struggled a lot as I could make the posters look like what I want. 
                    Then, I just moved around the shapes and add some graphics to see what it forms. 
                    I had also used Photoshop and Illustrator to help with changing the graphics to what I want.</br>
                    
                    <br>For the website, it was quite fun. 
                    I had made my own website before but I was not good at it. 
                    However, thanks to this project, it has changed my impression to html code. 
                    Even though I am still not good at it and I am confused sometimes, it is quite of overwhelming to see a website made by myself.
                     Moreover, making website is a very useful skill. 
                     After making my own website, I pay more attention to the layout of the website instead of the content when even I opened a website. </br>
